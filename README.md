## Solutions in rust

The challanges can be found [here](https://fly.io/dist-sys/)

# Getting started:

The first problem [Echo](https://fly.io/dist-sys/1/) has information about downloading and installing Maelstrom.

To run the test through the scripts, Maelstrom needs be be located in the parent folder of whirlpool.
